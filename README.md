# Autologin plugin for Flutter

Experimental autologin plugin for Flutter. This library should log in the user if the login data are already known by the operating system of the device e.g. on the first run.

This plugin uses for Android [Smartlock for Passwords](https://developers.google.com/identity/smartlock-passwords/android) and for iOS [AutoFill](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/204/).

## TODO

- [ ] Add documentation how to use it. In the mean time you can use the [example app](./example)
- [ ] Upload the final version to pub.dev
- [ ] Finish and verify iOS implementation #5
